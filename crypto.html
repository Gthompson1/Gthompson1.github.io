        <h2>Finding Triangular Abritrage within Crypto Currencies</h2>
        <p>This project was the first "Project" that I completed using python. While it may not blow anyone away,
            I think I will forever keep it here to remind me of how far I have come.
            With this being my first project, I had a lot of help in doing this one and it has also been a while
            since I have looked at this source code, which can be found on my github repo
            <a href="https://github.com/Gthompson1/data55/blob/main/cryptoarb" target="_blank">here</a></p>
        <p>While I recieved a lot of in-class help on this project from my professor. I also had to use Google in
            order to learn new modules and how to utilize them in the best way. Learning these new modules through
            their documentation was a really good step for me because it gave me expierence with using the documentation
            to learn a module and implemet that learning into my program to make it beter. Before this, all of my
            learning had come from the in class lectures and questions asked to my professor.</p>
