        <h2>Algo-Trading!</h2>
        <p>I found my passion for Algo-Trading after I took an intro Python programming course at Utah State University.</p>

        <a class="left" href="images/mr.jpg"><img src="images/mr.jpg" alt="Mean Reversion code" width=600 height=175> </a>
        
        <p>My first step was to write a program that would run an mean reversion trading strategy on a five day 
            moving average getting data from the Yahoo Finance module and using Alpaca as my broker.</p>
        <p>The first challenges that I ran into in this phase were simply getting my program to function the way
            I wanted it to. The second problem was how to chose what stocks to trade and put into my program. </p>
        <p>After a lot of trial and error to get my program running how I want it to, and a little research into
            stocks that would perform well with MR strategy, I was up and running. <br> <br> </p>
        
        <a class="right" href="images/Lambda.jpg"><img src="images/Lambda.jpg" alt="AWS Lambda" width=600 height=300></a>
        
        <p>AWS servers are really cheap (especioally the t.2 micro that I am using) however as a broke college
            student, every dollar is important. So, in order to keep costs as low as possible, I decided to utilize
            AWS Lambda to start my instance 5 minutes before my Crontab runs. This, in conjunction with AWS option 
            to shutdown my server after 30 mins of idle time saves a lot of money.</p>
        <p>However the Lambda function is only equipt to turn on my instance (the way that I have it set up)</p>

        <a class="left" href="images/Cloudwatch.jpg"><img src="images/Cloudwatch.jpg" alt="Cloudwatch" width=600 height=300 ></a>
        
        <p>Intro cloudwatch events! AWS has another service where you can link two things based off of an event. 
            For example, my cloud watch in plain english says "if its 1755 UTC time, then run this lambda function."</p>
        <p>Overall, I learned a lot during this project and it was a great project to expose myself into some of the 
            services that AWS has to offer, and the power of cloud computing!</p>
